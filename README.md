# CutBitMap

##### This is a project I have to do for my midterm exam in **"Programming techniques and practices"** class:

##### Write C/C++ program to cut bitmap file into equal parts in command-line. Each part is saved in a new Bitmap file.
##### *Command-line syntax:*
    `<program><file Bmp>[-h <parts in height>][-w <parts in width>]`
##### *Ex:* program cutbmp.exe
    - Cut 3 parts in height (save in 3 new Bitmap files):
        `cutbmp.exe d:/images/img1.bmp -h 3`
    - Cut 2 parts in height, 4 parts in width (save in 8 new Bitmap files)
        `cutbmp.exe d:/images/img1.bmp -h 2 -w 4`
